Somerville YIMBY — Yes In My Back Yard — is a group of Somerville residents advocating for smart growth that benefits everyone. We’re a part of a nationwide movement to create abundant housing, available to people in cities that have suffered from gentrification and expensive market rate housing. Like our friends [A Better Cambridge](https://www.abettercambridge.org), we support eco-friendly density and transit-centered growth to create vibrant, walkable, bikeable, livable neighborhoods with plenty of housing for all.

We believe that our cities and towns are great places, and we should welcome people who want to be here by creating abundant homes for new neighbors of all income levels.

For more about us, please see the [Somerville YIMBY Platform](/platform/).
