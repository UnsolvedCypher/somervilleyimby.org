Somerville YIMBY circulated a survey to candidates for mayor and city council this summer.

We are currently awaiting a few more candidates to turn in their responses, and expect to have all the responses we’re going to receive by <time datetime="2023-09-08T23:59:00-0400">Sept. 8</time>.

After we’ve received everyone’s responses, and deliberated them internally, we’ll provide a list of the candidates we’ve chosen to endorse, with a summary of our reasoning, as well as links to all of the candidates’ raw responses.

If you would like to read any of the candidates’ survey responses, we list them all below in alphabetical order, linking their name to a PDF of their survey response.
