## How and Why

Somerville and the Boston region as a whole are suffering through a housing affordability crisis. To address it, we need to build more housing.

Increased housing production, especially in dense areas near transit, helps our community in many ways:

* Increasing the number of homes relieves pressure on prices
* Inclusionary zoning creates subsidized housing, paid for by market-rate&nbsp;housing.
* Shorter commutes reduce pollution and fight climate change (and reduce traffic for drivers as well!)
* Greater density counteracts segregation and social isolation
* Construction jobs help the city’s economy

## Affordable Housing and Inclusionary Zoning

Somerville needs both subsidized and market-rate housing, and we need plenty of both. Many activists focus on the percentage of units that are designated as affordable; we prefer to maximize the number of affordable units created.

In other words, we’d rather see 20 affordable homes in a large building than 5 in a small one. After all, nobody can live in a percentage of a building that isn’t built.

We support policies that:


* Increase the availability of all kinds of housing, including subsidized and&nbsp;market-rate
* Make it easier to get around on foot, on transit, or by bike.
* Promote mixed-use development, broadening our tax base and creating jobs in Somerville
* Help people of different economic and social backgrounds live in and participate in the community
* Reduce carbon footprint and use space and energy efficiently
* Help Somerville coordinate with other towns and cities to address housing and development issues regionally
* Make the process of planning, permitting, and building transparent and&nbsp;predictable
