Please join us in addressing the housing affordability crisis! Our main organizing platform is [our Discourse](https://discourse.somervilleyimby.org/). It is available through the site, and can optionally be delivered to your inbox.

We also have a [Discord server](https://discord.com/invite/UePgDn7kf7) which is more oriented towards chat.

Typically, we have an in-person social, see [our calendar](/calendar/) for more information.
