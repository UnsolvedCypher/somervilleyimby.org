Today we dropped off our first zoning amendment petition with Somervilleâ€™s City Clerk!

This amendment will simplify & streamline the regulations for building or renovating dormers, removing multiple onerous rules that make it difficult or impossible for folks to modify their homes to better suit their ever-changing needs.

Special shout to our member Elliot for leading the charge & doing the hard work of writing this amendment, and to our 10 signatories to make it a valid petition!
