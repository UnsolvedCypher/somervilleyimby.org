The following is a letter we sent on <time datetime="2024-01-25">January 25, 2024</time>, expressing our continuing support for POAH’s efforts to rebuild Clarendon Hill.

> To the Executive Office of Housing and Livable Communities:
>
> We write in support of Preservation of Affordable Housing (POAH) and the Somerville Community Corporation (SCC) to continue redevelopment of affordable housing at Clarendon Hill in Somerville. This long-overdue project will provide badly needed homes for some of Somerville’s most vulnerable residents. Due to changing economic conditions, the market-rate portions of the project have been delayed, but the residents of Clarendon Hill cannot wait for interest rates to fall.
>
> Please approve this application, and help POAH and SCC continue to bring badly-needed affordable housing to Somerville.
> Warmly,
>
> Jeff Byrnes, Patrick Dignan, Laura Evans, and Aaron Weber
> Steering Committee
> Somerville YIMBY
